Synopsis: This project connects advanced research in mobile edge sensing and computing systems. The developed framework leads to a solid foundation for DNN and computer architecture design and optimization for mobile edge devices. It also strengthens the foundational technology and analysis in designing cost-effective computer systems and architectures for real-time mobile edge applications. The project results significantly improve the efficiency of deep learning in a large spectrum of research related to mobile edge computing, including the Internet of Things, mobile and pervasive sensing, and human-computer interaction. The outcomes of the proposal can improve hardware resource utilization in real-time data analytics, leading to increased efficiency of scientific outputs in many interdisciplinary communities. In addition to sharing results with the community, this project can benefit interdisciplinary curriculums with new research topics and tasks for undergraduate/graduate and minority students. The education program also includes outreach efforts to a broad range of student programs from K-5 to K-12 with local partners.
Synopsis2: This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
