Synopsis: This project seeks to conduct a comprehensive study to understand to what extent the current mobile devices can model various real-world driving behaviors and corresponding vehicle dynamics. A new real-time mobile sensing system, which combines real-time mobile sensing and heterogeneous driving environments, is developed to address driving safety concerns. The final results will be the abiding principles of cyber-physical architecture that resolve dynamic impacts of complex environments and provide clear guidelines over Internet of Things (IoTs). Specifically, effective features are investigated from mobile sensor readings that are able to depict each type of abnormal driving behaviors. These features can thus be extracted to localize the vehicles and derive the patterns of abnormal driving behaviors (e.g., weaving, swerving, fast U-turn, and sudden breaks) with the consideration of generic driving scenarios and heterogeneous mobile devices. Techniques based on machine learning are developed to generate a classifier model that could clearly identify fine-grained abnormal driving behaviors. The classifier model will be further utilized as a foundation to devise the location-aware driving safety system, which can track users' driving behaviors and realize location-related dangerous vehicular status in real-time using low-computing-capability mobile devices.
