Synopsis: The primary goal of this research is to build a software accelerator that enables the broad deployment of heavy-cost deep learning models into resource-constrained, heterogeneous mobile edge devices (e.g., low-cost sensing platforms and IoT devices). The basic idea is to develop deep-learning resource management algorithms that can adjust structures of different deep learning models according to hardware constraints of heterogeneous edge devices. More specifically, this research analyzes distinct deep learning behaviors on mobile edge devices and designs different strategies to improve the efficiency of multiple deep-learning-based inference models. Furthermore, this research develops algorithms that can adjust the complexity of different deep learning models to reduce their energy and memory consumption on mobile edge devices. In addition, this project designs power-centric resource reallocation algorithms to verify and deploy the mobile-friendly deep learning models.

Synopsis2: This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
